Meet Caius Verity, the transparent rogue. He’s the sort of man who announces, mid-step, “I’m about to pick your pocket,” and somehow makes it charming enough that the victim forgets to be alarmed. At a noble’s banquet, he might lean over a gilded railing, grin at the distracted guard, and say, “I’ll be rifling your coin purse while your back is turned. Consider it an exercise in trust.” And then he does exactly that, hands light, eyes sparkling, leaving the guard embarrassed, annoyed, and mildly impressed. Caius thrives in the spotlight, his mischief wrapped in honesty, turning expectation itself into a weapon.

Physically, he dresses like someone you’d notice in any crowd but never fear. A tailored longcoat sweeps his movements, gloves immaculate, pocket watch ticking audibly, dagger sheathed plainly at his side more as punctuation than threat. Every object around him becomes a potential tool -- tankards, candlesticks, rugs, ledger books -- and he wields them with the same flair and precision he uses to wield attention. In combat, he doesn’t vanish into shadows; he steps forward, announces each move, shoves a chair, hurls a book, directs his allies with perfectly timed cues, and makes the battlefield his stage.

Mechanically, Caius is a level 10 Mastermind rogue. He specializes in improvisation, social manipulation, and battlefield orchestration. His skills in Persuasion and Insight are unmatched, granting him the ability to predict enemy movements and influence ally actions. With the Tavern Brawler feat, every mundane object becomes a weapon, while his dagger exists as a clean, visible accent rather than a relied-upon tool. His combat style is open, declarative, and choreographed, with Help used from up to 30 feet to give allies advantage while he manipulates positioning and perception. He doesn’t rely on stealth, concealment, or surprise. He relies on clarity, timing, and audacious honesty.

Caius’s philosophy is simple: concealment is weak, deception is amateur, and transparency is the sharpest blade. He weaponizes the obvious, flooding the senses with truth until opponents misinterpret it. He rarely lies, but he thrives on the cognitive misdirection that comes from people underestimating what honesty in motion can accomplish. His quips are truth, his movements deliberate, his entire persona a study in expectation turned against itself. In a world full of shadowed assassins, Caius Verity walks openly into the fray and wins simply by being seen.
